# About
I think i made this in class last school year (2019) when i was just learning python in spare time to make games my friends could play. Showing games to my friends showed to make exception loops because they'll always just type random stuff...or not so randon stuff
It's mainly just stuff from my repl.it (https://replit.com/@Noah6544). So all interpreter based games and such, no file management.
# RPG-GAME
- I wrote this mainly in homeroom in 8th grade in december but for Christmas I remeber I coded a lot on a trip to baltimore (DRIVE). 
- I think it's 1000 lines because I was coding on repl.it and I didn't make new files for different "branches" of the program. I think I wanted to save old versions just in case something went wrong and the code wasn't salvagable
- I've looked at just a single function and there are so many things that are contradicting and wouldn't work the way I intended. 
- If you're interested in actually trying a version of the "game" that works, go to my other repository dedicated to the game.
